# Cyclistic-Case-Study

## *How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?*
**(Part of Google Data Analytics Certification)**

This case study is focused on the customer behavior of a bike-share company named Cyslictic based in Chicago, USA. Microsoft Excel is used for data cleaning and Microsoft SQL Server is used for data analysis. Data visualization is done with Tableau.

### *About the company*


In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

 Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

### *Objective*
Provide the marketing team with insights about customer behavior in order to design effective marketing strategies aimed at converting casual members into annual members.

We are going to focus on these questions :

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 

2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
